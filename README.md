This repository contains a Hack program demonstrating a stack overflow error in a recursive factorial function. The program calculates the factorial of a given integer using recursion.  However, for larger input values, the recursive calls consume excessive stack space, resulting in a stack overflow error.  A solution is provided to address this issue by using an iterative approach.
